# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I'm still struggling with my data types. I sometimes mix up string and boolean. I'm also struggling with my Google searches. They can still take me quite a bit of time.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

The note taking is getting much better. It actually helps me more to read through a lesson first, and then go back and take notes.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

Trying to solve a problem on my own first, but I think I need to Google more. I also need to Google more so that I can get better at it.
